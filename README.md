# Exercise 1:

I have always been a technology lover, from a very young age, my first program was a simple calculator which I developed with java and from there I began to love programming.

Usually my day starts with a good coffee, then when I sit at my workplace I start checking my emails, I check if there is any assignment in my =task manager such as Jira and from there I take a course, I prepare for the scrum daily And from there, when I am clear about my objectives for the day, I begin to develop them.
